### The Launch Post

**Title:**
ClipSync - Your clipboard, everywhere you need it

**Tagline:**
The clipboard manager built for developers

**Description:**
ClipSync is a comprehensive clipboard management platform that syncs your clipboard across all devices in real-time. Built specifically for developers, it includes powerful transformation tools, team collaboration features, and enterprise-grade security.

**Full Description:**

ClipSync is the clipboard manager developers have been waiting for.

**The Problem:**
As developers, we constantly copy code snippets, configuration files, JSON responses, and error messages. But when we need that content on another device, we're stuck with inefficient workarounds: email, Slack, chat apps, or manual transfers.

**The Solution:**
ClipSync syncs your clipboard in real-time across all your devices. Copy on your desktop, paste on your laptop. Instant. Seamless. Effortless.

**Key Features:**

🔄 **Real-Time Device Sync**
Desktop apps (Windows, Mac, Linux), mobile apps (iOS, Android), browser extensions (Chrome, Firefox), and IDE integrations (VS Code, Vim, Neovim) – all in perfect sync.

🛠️ **Developer-First Tools**
20+ text transformations: camelCase ↔ snake_case ↔ kebab-case, Base64 encode/decode, JSON beautify/minify, hash generation, UUID generation, and more.

👥 **Team Collaboration**
Shared team clipboards with role-based permissions, live sync across team members, activity tracking, and workspace organization.

🔒 **Enterprise Security**
End-to-end encryption, per-clip password protection, local-first storage, GDPR compliant, SOC 2 ready.

**What Makes ClipSync Different:**

- **Native Applications**: No browser required. Real desktop apps with system tray integration.
- **Developer-Specific**: Unlike generic clipboard managers, ClipSync was built for developers with transformation tools you'll actually use.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: The only clipboard manager with true real-time team collaboration.
- **Privacy-First**: Local storage with optional cloud sync. Your data stays yours.

**Use Cases:**

- **Multi-Device Developers**: Work seamlessly across desktop, laptop, tablet, and phone
- **Remote Teams**: Share code snippets instantly without chat apps
- **Technical Writers**: Access reference material across devices
- **DevOps Engineers**: Sync configurations and scripts across environments
- **Students**: Share code snippets with classmates

**Pricing:**
