Hi [Name],

The wait is over.

Today, we're thrilled to announce the official launch of **ClipSync** – the clipboard manager that developers have been waiting for.

We know you've been there: copied code on your desktop, only to realize you need it on your laptop. Shared snippets via email or Slack because there was no better way. Lost valuable code because you accidentally overwrote your clipboard.

ClipSync solves all of that.

🔄 **Real-Time Sync** – Copy on one device, paste on another instantly
💻 **Developer Tools** – 20+ text transforms, JSON formatting, hash generation
👥 **Team Collaboration** – Shared clipboards, live sync, role-based permissions
🔒 **Enterprise Security** – End-to-end encryption, per-clip protection, GDPR compliant

**Works everywhere you work:**
- Desktop apps (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Mobile apps (iOS, Android)
- Browser extensions (Chrome, Firefox)
- IDE integrations (VS Code, Vim, Neovim)

**Try it free today** → [Get ClipSync Free](https://clipsync.com/signup)

We believe ClipSync will transform how you work with code and text. Don't just take our word for it:
