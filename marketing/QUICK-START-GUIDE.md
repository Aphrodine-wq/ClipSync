## Troubleshooting

### "Clipboard isn't syncing"

**Check:**
1. Are you signed in on both devices?
2. Is your internet connection stable?
3. Is sync enabled in settings?

**Try:**
- Refresh sync: Settings → Sync → Force Refresh
- Restart the app
- Check sync status in settings

### "Clips aren't being captured"

**Check:**
1. Did you grant clipboard permissions?
2. Is ClipSync running in the background?
3. Is clipboard monitoring enabled?

**Try:**
- Restart ClipSync
- Re-grant permissions
- Check settings for monitoring status

### "App is slow"

**Check:**
1. How many clips do you have? (10,000+ can slow things down)
2. Are you on an older computer?
3. Is your disk nearly full?

**Try:**
- Clear old clips (Settings → Clear History)
- Enable auto-cleanup (Settings → Auto-delete after 30 days)
- Close other apps to free memory

**2. Organize with Spaces**
Create spaces for different projects, clients, or contexts. Keep your clips organized.

**3. Save Frequently Used Content as Snippets**
Don't re-type the same things. Save them as snippets for quick access.

**4. Use Transformations**
Stop manually converting text. Let ClipSync do the heavy lifting.

**5. Share with Your Team**
If you're on the Team plan, use shared spaces to collaborate in real-time.

**6. Keep Your History Clean**
Enable auto-cleanup or regularly delete old clips to keep things snappy.

**7. Explore the Command Palette**
Press `Ctrl+K` to access any feature quickly without navigating menus.

Don't scroll through history. Search by content, tag, or type to find clips instantly.
